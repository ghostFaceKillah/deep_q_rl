How standard layer works in blocks?

How recurrent layer works in blocks?
------------------------------------

For examples of this, see implementation of SimpleRecurrent and
blocks.bricks.recurrent in general.

def apply(self, inputs, states, mask=None)
of SimpleRecurrent is wrapped in an @recurrent decorator. This decorator's
idea is to be able to call apply for a sequence of inputs, where in 
actual apply method that is being wrapped there is only one step implemented.

I am having problems with this idea, I cannot get it to work with lasagne well.
